      <p>The movie and a website were created to showcase a special journey to NYUAD Leo - the main character - had. Since all the movie characters are cats, I decided to include the “all-cats” theme to the website as well. </p>

    <a href="https://github.com/oomie/comix"><h3>Comics</h3></a>
      <p>Maya, the main character, is a college student who was feeling a bit down after a long week of assignments and deadlines. She receives a text from her friend, Beena, to go on a city trip together. Despite her initial moodiness, Maya ends up having a lot of fun in the city and feels refreshed when they return to the campus in the evening.</p>

      <p>A group of students are working on their Comm Lab audio assignment when they are suddenly interrupted by a fire alarm. They decide to ignore the alarm, assuming it's just a drill, and continue working on their assignment. As soon as Jun catches on that they could be in real danger, it's already too late</p>

      <a href="https://github.com/hanoodd/exam"><h3>Award Winning Movie</h3></a>
      <p>The movie shows how Aadil, an Oscar winning actor and a certified Justin Bieber fan, tries to pass an exam and ends up getting an A+. We attempted to create a comical film by making Aadil break the rule – which, of course, we don’t encourage or endorse by any means.</p>
